        <hr color=teal>
        <div class="column">
            <p>Tim Berners-Lee (1955-) is the director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which is a web standards organization that helps the Internet reach its max potential. He also directs the World Wide Web Foundation (launched in 2009) which helps use the Internet's potential to benefit humanity as a whole. Of course, he is the inventor of the Internet -- first developed during his time at CERN in 1989.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Berners-Lee received the Turing Prize -- the "Nobel Prize of Computing" -- in April 2017 for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and essential protocols that allowed the Web to scale. It is one of the most prestigious awards in the computer science field.</p>

            <h3 class=title>Berners-Lee and the Future for the Internet</h3> <small><strong>Adapted from a Vanity Fair article on Berners-Lee</strong></small><br><br>
            <p>As the creator of the internet, Berners-Lee, ever since its inception, has carefully observed and watched it grow from an experimental tool to a worldwide phenomenon. However, he also is very worried about its future. <br><br><br> Seeing violations of privacy and appalling uses of the Internet by big tech corporations like Google and Amazon (such as when Facebook secretly conducted psychological experiments on ~700,000 people), Berners-Lee has always envisioned the Internet as not just a revolutionary tool for businesses and societies, but also a "destroyer of worlds, as Robert Oppenheimer once infamously observed of his own creation" <em>(Vanity Fair)</em>. His goal today is to try and resolve all these issues through a new experimental platform that focuses on decentralization, just like the one he developed at CERN decades ago. - <br> <!-- Image and caption #2 -->
                <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=RobertCailliauCERN.jpg width=450px alt="Picture of Robert Cailliau at CERN" id="robert"><br>
                <small><em>"Robert Cailliau, a systems engineer at CERN who was Tim Berners-Lee's first partner on the World Wide Web project." <strong>(CERN)</strong></em></small><br class="ext2"><br class="ext2"><br class="ext2"><br class="ext2"><br class="ext2">
        </div>
        <div class=column> Berners-Lee purposely made the Internet free to use as a platform and a tool, as he believed the Web could only survive if it was not restrained by a big centralized group or individual. However, as the Internet grew larger and larger, eventually big corporations began to take control as people began signing user agreements and relying on technology. It was created to promote equality, but with a central power it began to result in the opposite. <br><br>
            <p>His solution: Solid, an experimental platform by Berners-Lee that focuses on the principles that began the Internet -- a decentralized and free place where people can control their data, rather than by big corporations like Google. While it is still is very much not ready for a grand release to revolutionize the Internet yet, it has sparked many other similar projects by others worldwide for decentralization.</p><br><br>
